## About Tag 

In HTML heading tags (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) are used to have different types(/sizes) of headings in our HTML pages which means these tags create content hierarchy.
There are six levels of headings in HTML as `<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<h3>`,`<h4>`,`<h5>` and `<h6>` where `<h1>` indicates the most important headings and `<h6>`is the least.


#### Example:

```html
  <h1>This is a h1 type of heading<h1>
  <h2>This is a h2 type of heading<h2>
  <h3>This is a h3 type of heading<h3>
  <h4>This is a h4 type of heading<h4>
  <h5>This is a h5 type of heading<h5>
  <h6>This is a h6 type of heading<h6>
```

You can preview above html code extract as follows in a HTML page.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <h1>This is a h1 type of heading</h1>
  <h2>This is a h2 type of heading</h2>
  <h3>This is a h3 type of heading</h3>
  <h4>This is a h4 type of heading</h4>
  <h5>This is a h5 type of heading</h5>
  <h6>This is a h6 type of heading</h6>
</body>
</html>


It is a good practise to use heading tags only to have headings. If you want to make your letters big or bold there are separated tags in HTML for these purposes.
HTML `<h1>` to `<h6>` are supported for both HTML event attributes and global attributes.

The `<align>` attribute specifies the horizontal alignment of the heading. But since after HTML5 this attribute is not supported for heading tags. Instead you can use CSS properties.
